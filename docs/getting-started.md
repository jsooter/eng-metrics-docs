# Getting Started

Clone [eng-metrics-suite](https://github.com/GitUltraHQ/eng-metrics-suite),
then:

```
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set a POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and the token(s) for whichever
# provider(s) you're importing from (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure DevOps)

sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/eng-metrics-suite
sudo chown "$(id -u):$(id -g)" /var/lib/eng-metrics-suite
mkdir -p reports

docker compose up -d
```

## Why the two `mkdir`s

`/var/lib/eng-metrics-suite` is where config files (not secrets — those
go in `.env`) live: `discover_repos.py`'s `--config` YAML (see
[Discovering Repos](discovering-repos.md)) and `report.py`'s `--team-map`
CSV (see [Generating Reports](generating-reports.md)) both get read from
there, mounted read-only into the relevant containers at the same path.
It needs to exist *before* `docker compose up` — Docker will auto-create
it as root-owned otherwise, which then blocks you from writing to it
without `sudo`.

`./reports` needs the same up-front `mkdir`, for a related but different
reason: `eng-reports` runs as a non-root user (UID 1000) so its output
isn't root-owned on the host, but that only helps once the directory
already exists with the right owner. If Docker has to auto-create
`./reports` itself (e.g. because you skipped this step), it does so as
root, and the non-root container then can't write into it at all
(`PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied`). If your host user
isn't UID 1000 (check with `id -u`), add `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` to
the `docker compose run` commands in [Generating
Reports](generating-reports.md) instead.

## What `docker compose up` actually starts

Postgres, plus the `git-processor` and `pr-processor` workers (and
`issue-processor`, if your compose bundle includes it — see
[Jira Integration](jira-integration.md)). The workers exit as soon as
they find nothing queued to do — that's expected, not a crash;
`restart: unless-stopped` just means they check again periodically
rather than sitting in a busy loop. Nothing happens until you queue
some repos — continue to [Discovering Repos](discovering-repos.md).
