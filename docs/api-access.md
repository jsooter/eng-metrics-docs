# API Access (Team / Enterprise)

Everything on this site so far covers the free, self-hosted pipeline:
import commit/PR data, then generate a PDF report on demand. **Team and
Enterprise plans** add a REST/JSON API on top of the same database, so
your own internal dashboards (Grafana, an internal tool, whatever you
already use) can pull these metrics directly and on your own schedule,
instead of regenerating and re-reading a PDF.

Like the rest of this pipeline, it's **self-hosted**: it runs in your
own infrastructure, against your own database. Two credentials gate it
-- a license key we issue you, and an API key you generate and control
yourself (see "Auth" below for the difference). No data leaves your
instance to make this work, and there's nothing to sign up for beyond
the plan itself.

## Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON and accept a required `start`/`end` date
range, plus optional scoping (see below).

| Endpoint | What it returns |
|---|---|
| Author activity | Per-author commits, lines added/removed, files changed, churn ratio, and active-days/week (a consistency-of-contribution signal) -- plus PR counts and average commits per PR. |
| Review health | PR/merge counts, cycle time broken into pickup (open → first review) and review (first review → merge) stages with p50/p90 percentiles, per-reviewer load, and a review-load-balance (Gini coefficient) score. |
| Repo trends | Weekly commit/PR volume and churn ratio, per repo. |
| Cycle time | The pickup/review/total percentile breakdown as its own endpoint, for dashboards that only need that slice. |
| Deployment frequency | Weekly deployment counts per repo (every git tag counts by default; scope down to a real deploy-tagging convention with a tag-pattern filter). |
| Lead time for changes | p50/p90/avg hours from a commit to its nearest later tag. |
| Change failure rate | Percentage of deployments (tags) linked to a Jira incident via that incident's Fix Version field, exact-matched to the tag name. Requires the optional [issue-processor](https://github.com/GitUltraHQ/issue-processor) Jira integration -- returns 0/`null` with `jira_configured_repo_count: 0` if it isn't set up, not a misleading 0%. |
| Mean time to restore (MTTR) | p50/p90/avg hours from a linked incident's creation to its resolution. Same issue-processor dependency as change failure rate above; still-open incidents are excluded from the average but reported separately as `open_excluded`. |
| AI usage | Per-author and org-wide weekly trend of commits with an AI-tool `Co-authored-by:` trailer (the same convention GitHub itself reads to show a tool's avatar on a commit) -- a lower bound on AI-assisted work, not a precise measurement. |
| Investment allocation | Ticket/story-point distribution, allocation trend, cycle time, and logged time, per Jira-ticket category. Requires issue-processor's separate allocation-tracking flow (independent of the CFR/MTTR one above). **Not scoped by `repo`/`org`/`team` at all** -- see "Scoping" below. |
| Author distribution trend | Weekly p50/p90 (never a per-author number) of commit count, churn ratio, and active days -- the anonymized, ranking-safe alternative to a per-author leaderboard. |
| Reviewer distribution trend | Weekly p50/p90 of reviews-per-reviewer, same anonymization reasoning as above. |
| Commits-after-open distribution trend | Weekly p50/p90 of avg commits pushed after a PR was opened, per PR. |

Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and MTTR are the
four canonical DORA metrics -- all four are available here.

## Scoping

Every endpoint accepts:

- `repo` (repeatable) and/or `org` -- limit to specific repos, same as
  the free CLI's `--repo`/`--org`.
- `team` -- limit to a team's repos and (where the data has a real git
  author identity, like commits and AI usage) filter to that team's own
  members, not just repos they happen to touch. Requires a team roster
  to be configured. PR/review data and deployment frequency can't be
  attributed to a team the same way (a PR author is a vendor-API
  username, not a git email; a tag isn't authored by anyone), so those
  stay repo-scoped.

`repo`/`org` and `team` are mutually exclusive.

**Investment allocation is the one exception** -- it accepts none of
`repo`/`org`/`team`. Jira tickets have no repo relationship (allocation
tracking is purely Jira-side data), so there's nothing to scope by; it
always returns one combined view across every tracked Jira project.

## Example

```
curl "https://your-instance/v1/author-activity?start=2026-01-01&end=2026-04-01&team=Platform" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your key>"
```

```json
{
  "commit_activity": [
    {
      "author_email": "alice@example.com",
      "author_name": "Alice Anderson",
      "commits": 47,
      "added": 1704,
      "removed": 340,
      "churn_ratio": 0.17,
      "active_days_per_week": 1.6
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "start": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z",
    "team_scope": {"team": "Platform", "repo_count": 20}
  }
}
```

## Auth

Two separate credentials are involved, easy to conflate since both are
just an env var and a header -- don't mix them up:

- **License key** (`GITULTRA_LICENSE_KEY`) -- gates the deployment
  itself. **We issue this to you** after you get plan access (see
  "Getting access" below); it's not something you generate. The service
  checks it once at startup and refuses to boot without a valid one --
  see [eng-api](https://github.com/GitUltraHQ/eng-api)'s README for
  details.
- **API key** (`API_KEY`/`ENG_API_KEY`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer
  <key>`) -- authenticates *your own dashboards'* requests to your
  already-running instance. **You generate this yourself** (see below);
  we never see or store it.

Every request needs `Authorization: Bearer <key>` using the API key
(not the license key). Once you have plan access, there's no separate
account/key request step for the API key -- only the license key comes
from us.

### Generating an API key

Any sufficiently random string works -- a UUID, a password manager's
generator, whatever you already reach for. If you don't have a
preferred method:

```
openssl rand -hex 32
```

or, without `openssl`:

```
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Set the result as `ENG_API_KEY` in your `.env` (if you're running the
`eng-metrics-suite-pro` compose bundle) or as the `API_KEY` environment
variable directly (if running the container standalone) -- then send it
back as `Authorization: Bearer <that value>` on every request. Treat it
like any other credential: don't commit it, and rotate it (just
generate a new one and restart the container) if you suspect it's
leaked.

## Getting access

Available on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans -- see
[gitultra.com](https://gitultra.com) for plan details, or apply for
beta access there if you're interested. Once you have access, we issue
you a **license key** (`GITULTRA_LICENSE_KEY`, valid 90 days, renewed on
request) -- set that alongside the API key you generate yourself (see
"Auth" above) and you're running.
